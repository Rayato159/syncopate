# Zombie Implementation for Syncopate Horror Game

## Overview
This document describes the zombie system implemented for your 2D pixel art horror game using Rust Bevy 0.16.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ 2 Zombies Spawning
- **Location**: Zombies spawn at predefined positions on the map
- **Default spawn points**:
  - Position 1: (-400.0, 200.0)
  - Position 2: (400.0, -200.0)
- **Configuration**: Easily customizable via `ZombieConfig` resource

### ✅ Pathfinding to Player
- **Algorithm**: A* pathfinding using the `pathfinding` crate
- **Grid-based**: Uses the game's tilemap grid (32x32 tiles)
- **Update frequency**: Path recalculates every 0.5 seconds
- **Fallback**: Direct movement if pathfinding fails
- **Movement speed**: 80.0 pixels/second (slower than player's 160.0)

### ✅ Player Attack System
- **Damage**: 25 damage per hit
- **Attack cooldown**: 1.5 seconds between attacks
- **Attack range**: 40 pixels (close combat)
- **Collision detection**: Both distance-based and Rapier collision events
- **Player health**: 100 HP max, damage displayed in console

## Code Structure

### New Files Created
```
src/characters/zombie.rs    # Complete zombie system implementation
```

### Key Components
```rust
#[derive(Component)]
pub struct Zombie {
    pub speed: f32,              // Movement speed
    pub health: f32,             // Zombie health
    pub damage: f32,             // Attack damage
    pub attack_cooldown: Timer,  // Attack timing
    pub path_update_timer: Timer, // Pathfinding update
    pub current_path: Option<Vec<(i32, i32)>>, // Current path
    pub current_target_index: usize, // Path progress
}
```

### Systems Added
1. **`setup_zombies`** - Initializes zombie resources and spawns zombies
2. **`update_zombie_ai`** - Handles pathfinding and movement towards player
3. **`zombie_attack_system`** - Manages combat and damage dealing
4. **`update_zombie_animation_direction`** - Updates animations based on movement
5. **`update_player_health_display`** - Shows player health status
6. **`despawn_zombies`** - Cleanup on game exit

## Integration Points

### Main Game Loop
- Zombies spawn when entering `GameState::InGame`
- Systems run in `GameUpdateSet::Thunwa` set
- Respect pause state (`PauseState::InGame`)

### Player Integration
- Added `health` and `max_health` to `Thunwa` component
- Added `PlayerHealth` marker component
- Damage system integrates with existing player movement

### Physics Integration
- Uses Rapier2D for collision detection
- Zombie colliders: `Collider::capsule_y(8., 8.)`
- Rigidbody setup: `RigidBody::Dynamic` with rotation locked

## Assets

### Current Setup
- **Placeholder sprite**: Uses `thunwa_sprite.aseprite` as temporary zombie sprite
- **Animations**: Reuses Thunwa's animations (idle-front, walk-front, walk-left, walk-right, walk-back)

### Required Asset
Create `assets/characters/zombie/zombie_sprite.aseprite` with the following animation tags:
- `idle` (or directional idle animations)
- `walk` (or directional walk animations)

## Configuration

### Zombie Settings
```rust
Zombie {
    speed: 80.0,           // Movement speed
    health: 100.0,         // Zombie health (for future use)
    damage: 25.0,          // Attack damage
    attack_cooldown: 1.5,  // Seconds between attacks
}
```

### Player Settings
```rust
Thunwa {
    health: 100.0,         // Player health
    max_health: 100.0,     // Maximum health
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Custom zombie sprites** - Replace placeholder with actual zombie animations
2. **Health UI** - Add visual health bar instead of console output
3. **Zombie variety** - Different zombie types with varying stats
4. **Sound effects** - Attack sounds, zombie groans, damage sounds
5. **Player combat** - Allow player to fight back against zombies
6. **Zombie death** - Remove zombies when health reaches zero
7. **Spawn system** - Wave-based spawning or respawning
8. **Obstacle avoidance** - Better pathfinding around map obstacles
9. **Visual feedback** - Damage flash, attack animations
10. **Game over state** - Proper game over screen when player dies

### Technical Debt
- Health display system could be improved with proper UI integration
- Pathfinding could be optimized with obstacle detection
- Animation system could be more sophisticated for zombie behaviors

## Testing

### Verified Features
- ✅ Zombies spawn at correct positions
- ✅ Pathfinding finds routes to player
- ✅ Zombies follow calculated paths
- ✅ Attack system deals damage correctly
- ✅ Health tracking works properly
- ✅ Game over detection triggers at 0 HP
- ✅ Collision detection works
- ✅ Cooldown system prevents attack spam

### How to Test
1. Run the game with `cargo run`
2. Navigate to the game area
3. Observe zombies approaching from spawn points
4. Let zombies reach you to see damage system
5. Watch console for health updates and attack messages

## Dependencies Used
- `pathfinding = "4.14.0"` - A* pathfinding algorithm
- `bevy_rapier2d` - Physics and collision detection
- `bevy_aseprite_ultra` - Sprite animation system

The zombie system is fully functional and ready for gameplay. The implementation provides a solid foundation for horror game mechanics with room for expansion and refinement.
