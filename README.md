# Syncopate

**Syncopate** is a 2D pixel art sci-fi horror game, blending intense sci-fi horror with rhythm-based combat mechanics. Set in the heart of modern-day Bangkok, the story follows **Thunwa Phakdeepong**, a genius mathematician turned investigator, and his rookie partner **Ravissara Thanakul** as they confront mysteries linked to escaped experimental monsters.

## 📚 Story and Setting

In an alternate version of Bangkok, Thailand, monsters created in a black-budget bioengineering lab have escaped into the real world. The only way to track them down is to think like them. You are part of a specialized unit trained to do just that — combining **mathematics**, **forensic logic**, and **instinct**.
